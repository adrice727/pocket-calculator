*** Pocket Calculator ***

 - Calculator is built using Angular and Node/Express
 - To view the app, perform an npm install, run 'server.js', and go to
   localhost:8080 in the browser.
 - Intermediate calculations are not performed.  Instead, they are stored in a
   string which is sent to the server to be calculated when a user presses
   enter or the '=' key on the calculator.
